This is a VERY early 'build' of my Python Halo Modules.  Right now, there are not any solid set up instructions, so you will probably need some understanding of python to get it working. Alternatively, raise an issue and I can try to help you get it set up!

I am planning on fleshing it out over the coming months, including a more user friendly interface for setup and config.
